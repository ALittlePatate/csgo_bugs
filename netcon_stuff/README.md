## netcon stuff

GitHub user [@VideoAmp/team-name](https://github.com/403-Fruit) figured out that netcon works in the CSGO client for some reason. You can do some fun automation with this as it provides read/write access to the game console while playing.

To activate run CSGO with -netconport [PORT].

The [hitmarker](https://github.com/kkthxbye-code/csgo_bugs/tree/master/netcon_stuff/hitmarker) directory contains a proof of concept made by [szmarczak](https://github.com/szmarczak).

Also check out [csctl](https://github.com/403-Fruit/csctl) by [@VideoAmp/team-name](https://github.com/403-Fruit).

More stuff will probably be added when I get the time.
